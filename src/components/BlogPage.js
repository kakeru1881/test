      <p>North Korea,
        officially the Democratic People's Republic of Korea ,
        is a country in East Asia. It constitutes the northern half of the Korean 
        Peninsula and borders China and Russia to the north at the Yalu and Tumen rivers, 
        and South Korea to the south at the Korean Demilitarized Zone. North Korea's border with 
        South Korea is a disputed border as both countries claim the entirety of the Korean Peninsula. 
        The country's western border is formed by the Yellow Sea, while its eastern border is defined by 
        the Sea of Japan. North Korea, like its southern counterpart, claims to be the 
        legitimate government of the entire peninsula and adjacent islands. 
        Pyongyang is the capital and largest city.
